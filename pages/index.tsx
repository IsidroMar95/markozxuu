      <p>
        Started programming in late 2015 on his own. Markoz has no college
        degree, he is a strong believer in the idea that you can learn a lot
        about programming through blog readings and online courses. He created a
        couple of <b>games</b> in unity3d and I also create some{' '}
        <b>applications </b>
        for the Android operating system that were published in Google play. In
        his spare time he practices photography like skateboarding.
